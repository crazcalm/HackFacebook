While at the facebook Hackathon, I joined a team that wanted to work on one of their past projects. Because this project is not mine, I will not dislose the details of the project. However, the contributions that I made to the were, in terms of the grand scheme of things, not that important. Because of this, I am willing to post some of the files that I created or refactored for their project.

Note: These files were created at a Hackathon. So the work created at 4 am is not going to look as pretty was the work created when I am fully functional person.

For example, in funny.py, there is a function called "haha." At 4 in the morning, importing funny into your file and calling the function "funny.haha()" is really funny to me. I laughed for a good 20 minutes.
